/**
 * @file nrf_802154_buffer_mgr_dst.h
 * @brief Buffer management for destination peer of a nRF 802.15.4 serialization.
 *
 * Receiving a buffer from a remote peer and then sending notification about
 * that buffer is a common scenario in serialization.
 *
 * This module is intended for a local peer who receives a buffer content
 * referenced by @c buffer_handle from a remote peer.
 * Function @ref nrf_802154_buffer_mgr_dst_add allows creation of a copy of
 * received content and provides a native local pointer to the copy of received
 * data. When local peer needs to notify a remote peer about some events related
 * to the buffer @ref nrf_802154_buffer_mgr_dst_search_by_local_pointer function
 * can be used to map a local pointer to @c buffer_handle the buffer has been
 * received with. When local peer is done with given buffer
 * @ref nrf_802154_buffer_mgr_dst_remove_by_local_pointer should be called to
 * remove mapping and free any resources used by the mapping.
