/**
 * @file nrf_802154_buffer_mgr_src.h
 * @brief Buffer management on source side of a buffer of a nRF 802.15.4 serialization.
 *
 * Sending a buffer to a remote peer and then receiving asynchronous
 * notification about that buffer from the remote peer is a common scenario in
 * serialization. This module is intended for a local peer who needs to send
 * a buffer to a remote peer. The existence of the buffer is out of scope of
 * this module. Function @ref nrf_802154_buffer_mgr_src_add allows creation of
 * a @c buffer_handle which can be sent with a buffer content to a remote peer.
 * The remote peer can then reference the buffer in the local peer by providing
 * the @c buffer_handle. The local peer can map a received @c buffer_handle to
 * the original buffer pointer by a call to
 * @ref nrf_802154_buffer_mgr_src_search_by_buffer_handle.
 * When the local peer is done with given buffer it should call
 * @ref nrf_802154_buffer_mgr_src_remove_by_buffer_handle.
 *
 * The source peer manages buffer existence by its own discretion. The buffer
 * shall exist as long as @c buffer_handle to pointer mapping exists.
