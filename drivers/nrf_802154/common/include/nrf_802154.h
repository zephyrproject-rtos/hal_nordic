 * Additional CCA attempts can be requested by the caller through @p p_metadata. In that case CCA
 * procedure is repeated back-to-back either until it returns idle channel and the transmission
 * starts, or until 1 + @p p_metadata->extra_cca_attempts CCA attempts are performed. The maximum
 * allowed number of additional CCA attempts is 254 so that the total number of CCA attempts doesn't
 * exceed 255.
 *
 * This function is designed to transmit the first symbol of SHR at @p tx_time provided that
 * the number of CCA attempts that will be performed is deterministic, which is only the case when
 * no attempts are performed or when a single attempt is performed. Otherwise, the function assumes
 * that @p tx_time points to a moment where the transmission would start if the first CCA attempt
 * detected idle channel. If the first CCA detects busy channel and additional CCA attempts follow,
 * the moment of transmission (first symbol of SHR) is delayed by the time taken by additional CCA
 * attempts, which is a multiple of the duration of a single CCA attempt.
 *
 * The below diagram shows an example sequence where two additional CCA attempts are performed.
 * TT denotes turnaround time necessary to switch from CCA to Tx. @p tx_time points to a moment in
 * time that occurs TT after the first CCA finishes.
