/**
 * @brief Verifies if the given part of the frame is valid.
 *
 * This function filters the given frame within the scope specified by @p filter_mode argument.
 * In the @c NRF_802154_FILTER_MODE_FCF filter mode the function will reject all frames that do
 * not satisfy requirements that can be determined by parsing the FCF field, such as unsupported
 * frame versions, unsupported frame types, or when destination addressing is not present in the
 * frame and the node is not a coordinator.
 * In the @c NRF_802154_FILTER_MODE_DST_ADDR filter mode the function will only check if the
 * destination address matches the address of the current node. If the incoming frame has no address
 * and the node is a coordinator the frame will be accepted. No validation of FCF is performend.
 *
 * To perform a full filtering procedure it is necessary to call this function on the incoming frame
 * with both @c NRF_802154_FILTER_MODE_FCF and @c NRF_802154_FILTER_MODE_DST_ADDR scopes in
 * two iterations, or both at once using @c NRF_802154_FILTER_MODE_ALL.
 *
 * @param[in] p_frame_data Pointer to a frame parser data of the frame to be filtered.
 * @param[in] filter_mode  The filtering scope that should be performed by the function.
 *
 * @retval NRF_802154_RX_ERROR_NONE               Verified part of the incoming frame is valid.
 * @retval NRF_802154_RX_ERROR_INVALID_FRAME      Verified part of the incoming frame is invalid.
 * @retval NRF_802154_RX_ERROR_INVALID_DEST_ADDR  Incoming frame has destination address that
 *                                                mismatches the address of this node.
 * @retval NRF_802154_RX_ERROR_INVALID_LENGTH     Received a frame with invalid length.
