/**
@mainpage Introduction and configuration

nrfx is a standalone set of drivers for peripherals present in Nordic
Semiconductor's SoCs. It provides drivers that can be used in various environments
without the necessity to integrate other parts of the SDK into them.
For the user's convenience, the drivers come with the MDK package. This package
contains definitions of register structures and bitfields for all supported
SoCs, as well as startup and initialization files for them.

Refer to the @ref nrfx_drv_supp_matrix to check which drivers are suitable
for a given SoC.

@section nrfx_integration Integration

The purpose of nrfx is to make it possible to use the same set of peripheral
drivers in various environments, from RTOSes to bare metal applications.
Hence, for a given host environment, a light integration layer must be provided
that implements certain specific routines, like interrupt management, critical
sections, assertions, or logging. This is done by filling a predefined set of
macros with proper implementations (or keeping some empty if desired) in files
named:
- @ref nrfx_glue
- @ref nrfx_log

Templates of these files are provided
in the <a href="https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nrfx/tree/master/templates">nrfx/templates</a> subfolder. Their customized
versions can be placed in any location within the host environment that the
used compiler can access via include paths.

In addition, the following locations should be specified as include paths
([nrfx] stands for the nrfx root folder location):
@code
[nrfx]/
[nrfx]/bsp/stable
[nrfx]/drivers/include
@endcode

@note Unless otherwise stated, nrfx API functions do not provide thread safety
      themselves. Users are responsible for providing the proper synchronization
      of the nrfx function calls in a given environment if those are to be used
      from different contexts.

@section nrfx_irq_handlers IRQ handlers

The IRQ handlers in all drivers are implemented as ordinary API functions
named "nrfx_{peripheral}_irq_handler". These functions accept pointer
to the driver instance structure as an argument and must be called upon execution
of IRQ handler from the interrupt vector table,
so the driver is made aware of the hardware event occurrence.

@section nrfx_configuration Configuration

The drivers use both dynamic (run time) and static (compile time) configuration.

Dynamic configuration is done by specifying desired options in configuration
structures passed to the drivers during their initialization.
Refer to the API reference for a given driver to see the members of its
configuration structure.

Static configuration allows enabling and disabling their specific features,
defining default parameters for dynamic configuration, parametrization of
logging in particular drivers. It is done by specifying desired values of macros
in a file named:

- nrfx_config.h

This file, similarly to the integration files mentioned above, can be placed
in any suitable location within the host environment.
The <a href="https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nrfx/tree/master/templates">nrfx/bsp/stable/templates</a> subfolder contains templates of
configuration files for all currently supported Nordic SoCs. These files are
included through a common nrfx_config.h file, according to the selected SoC.
Refer to the "driver configuration" section in the API reference for a given
driver for more information regarding configuration options available for it.

@section nrfx_api_change_procedure API change procedure

Starting from 3.0 release, nrfx API can no longer be considered as stable for minor version updates.
Taking into account the potential impact on the end users, APIs are changed in a few stages.
Every deprecated API is completely removed from the code base after two minor releases,
counting from the one making the functionality obsolete.
Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nrfx/wiki/API-change-procedure">API change procedure</a>
for more details regarding the process.

@section nrfx_additional_reqs Additional requirements

Nordic SoCs are based on ARM® Cortex™-M series processors and some contain RISC-V coprocessors.
Before you can start developing with nrfx, you must add the CMSIS header files to include
paths during the compilation process. Download these files from the following
website:

-  <a href="https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS"> ARM® CMSIS repository</a>
(CMSIS/Include directory)

@section nrfx_samples nrfx samples

You can refer to the <a href="https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nrfx_samples_3.8.0/page/index.html">latest release of nrfx samples</a> for the usage examples of nrfx drivers within Zephyr RTOS.

@section HALY

Starting from 4.0 release, Extended Hardware Access Layer API located in <a href="https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nrfx/tree/master/haly">nrfx/haly</a> directory is no longer developed.
API stability, support for new peripherals or extension for existing ones is not guaranteed.
