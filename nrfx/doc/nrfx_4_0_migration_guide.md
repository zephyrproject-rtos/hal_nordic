# nrfx 4.0 migration notes

nrfx 4.0 introduces API and structure changes. This guide lists actions required to make your code compatible with these changes.

## BSP (Board Support Package)

- Added new directory that contains:
  - MDK
  - SoC-specific templates
  - SoC-specific defines from nrfx drivers
  - Soc-specific files from soc/ directory (IRQ handlers and interconnect)
<br>Action : Always include `nrfx.h` header globally, do not include sub-headers like `nrf.h` or `nrf_erratas.h`.

## Errata

- Reworked the errata system. The workarounds for unsupported SoCs were removed. Summary table [Doxygen file](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nrfx/blob/master/doc/errata.dox) was created, which presents the currently implemented workarounds in nrfx.
- Added the following errata workarounds:
  - nRF52 Series:
    - 58,
    - 173,
    - 174,
    - 214,
  - nRF53 Series:
    - 65,
    - 119,
  - nRF91 Series:
    - 7 (added nrfx_nvmc_uicr_word_write() and fixed nrfx_nvmc_otp_halfword_read())
<br>Action : Remove fixes for errata now handled internally by the nrfx.
- Some errata are now disabled by default, even if the chip should apply them. They should be carefully enabled by the user on a case-by-case manner. The list includes:
  - nRF52 Series erratum 58,
  - nRF52 Series erratum 109.
  - nRF54H Series erratum 62.
<br>Actions :
  - If required, explicitly enable nRF52 Series erratum 58 workaround, by defining `NRF52_ERRATA_58_ENABLE_WORKAROUND` to `1`.
  - If required, explicitly enable nRF52 Series erratum 109 workaround, by defining `NRF52_ERRATA_109_ENABLE_WORKAROUND` to `1`.
  - If required, explicitly enable nRF54H Series erratum 62 workaround, by defining `NRF54H_ERRATA_62_ENABLE_WORKAROUND` to `1`.

## Error codes

All nrfx drivers and helpers now return int errno values. Failed function execution is indicated by negative return value. `nrfx_err_t` type is deprecated.
<br>Action : Update the affected code. Update implementation of `NRFX_LOG_ERROR_STRING_GET` macro to new error type.

## Instance interrupt handlers

Some nrfx drivers now expect instance specific interrupt handlers to be defined by users using `NRFX_INSTANCE_IRQ_HANDLER_DEFINE`. Macro expects three parameters - lowercase peripheral name, instance index and address of peripheral instance.
<br>Action : Define instance specific interrupt handler for affected drivers.

## Configuration

- Removed instance specific driver enablement configs, eg. `NRFX_SPIM20_ENABLED`.
    <br>Action : Do not redefine these symbols, nrfx now considers all present peripheral instances to be enabled.
- Drivers are no longer dependent on driver enablement configs, eg. `NRFX_SPIM_ENABLED`.
    <br>Action : Adjust build system to add appropriate driver source files to compilation accordingly, rather that relying on preprocessor symbols to disable driver source file contents.

## HALYs

HALY is now deprecated for all peripherals.
<br>Action : Use respective HAL functions instead or migrate to driver.

## Drivers

### CLOCK

- Split `nrfx_clock` driver into separate drivers for each clock type :
  - `nrfx_clock_hfclk`
  - `nrfx_clock_hfclk192m`
  - `nrfx_clock_hfclkaudio`
  - `nrfx_clock_lfclk`
  - `nrfx_clock_xo`

    <br>Action : No action required from user.
- `nrfx_clock_hfclk_is_running` function has been renamed to `nrfx_clock_hfclk_running_check`.

## Helpers

### GPPI

GPPI has been reworked to accommodate for a multi-instance DPPI architecture present in the newest SoC, e.g. nRF54 famlily. GPPI focuses on establishing and managing connections between endpoints or domains rather than a particular channels. Connection can spread across multiple and consists of resources in mutliple DPPIC and PPIB instances. Legacy architecture with a single PPI or DPPIC instance can be seen as the simplest example. GPPI API provides API for a basic one-to-one connection and API that allows to setup more complex many-to-many, spreading across multiple domains, connections.

## HALs

### CACHE

- `nrf_cache_data_get`, `nrf_cache_tag_get`, `nrf_cache_line_validity_check`, `nrf_cache_mru_get`, `nrf_cache_data_unit_validity_check` and `nrf_cache_is_data_unit_dirty_check` now expect `NRF_CACHE_Type` as their first parameter.
   <br>Action : Update the affected code by using `NRF_CACHE`, `NRF_DCACHE` or `NRF_ICACHE`.

### CLOCK

- Removed deprecated `nrf_clock_lf_actv_src_get`, `nrf_clock_lf_is_running` and `nrf_clock_hf_is_running` functions and `nrf_clock_start_task_status_t` enumerator.
    <br>Action: Use `nrf_clock_is_running` instead.
- Removed deprecated `nrf_clock_lf_start_task_status_get` and `nrf_clock_hf_start_task_status_get` functions.
    <br>Action : Use `nrf_clock_start_task_check` instead.

### COMP

- Renamed `nrf_isource_t` type to `nrf_comp_isource_t`.
    <br>Action : Update the affected code.

### LPCOMP

- Removed deprecated `NRF_LPCOMP_REF_EXT_REF0` and `NRF_LPCOMP_REF_EXT_REF1` symbols from `nrf_lpcomp_ref_t` enumerator.
    <br>Action : Use `NRF_LPCOMP_EXT_REF_REF0` or `NRF_LPCOMP_EXT_REF_REF1` symbols from `nrf_lpcomp_ext_ref_t` enumerator instead.
- Removed deprecated `nrf_lpcomp_configure` function and `nrf_lpcomp_config_t` type.
    <br>Action : Use dedicated functions to configure specific parameters.

### POWER

- Removed deprecated `nrf_power_rampower_t` enumerator.
    <br>Action : Use `NRF_POWER_RAMPOWER_S0POWER_POS` or `NRF_POWER_RAMPOWER_S0RETENTION_POS` symbols instead.
- Removed deprecated `nrf_power_vreg_enable` and `nrf_power_vreg_disable` functions.
    <br>Action : Use `nrf_power_vreg_set` instead.
- Removed deprecated `nrf_power_vreg_enable_check` function.
    <br>Action : Use `nrf_power_vreg_get` instead.

### RESET

- Removed `NRF_RESET_HAS_APPLICATION` symbol.
    <br>Action : Update the affected code.

### SAADC

- Removed deprecated `NRF_SAADC_8BIT_SAMPLE_WIDTH` symbol.
    <br>Action : Update the affected code, all SAADC samples are 16 bits wide now.
- Defined `nrf_saadc_value_t` type as `int16_t`. `nrf_saadc_value_min_get`, `nrf_saadc_value_max_get`, `nrf_saadc_value_min_get` and `nrf_saadc_value_max_get` functions now return `nrf_saadc_value_t` type.
    <br>Action : Update the affected code.
