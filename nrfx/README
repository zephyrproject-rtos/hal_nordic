Origin:
   https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nrfx/tree/v2.4.0

Status:
   v2.4.0

Purpose:
   With added proper shims adapting it to Zephyr's APIs, nrfx will provide
   peripheral drivers for Nordic SoCs.

Description:
   nrfx is a standalone set of drivers for peripherals present in Nordic
   Semiconductor's SoCs. It originated as an extract from the nRF5 SDK.
   The intention was to provide drivers that can be used in various
   environments without the necessity to integrate other parts of the SDK
   into them. For the user's convenience, the drivers come with the MDK
   package. This package contains definitions of register structures and
   bitfields for all supported SoCs, as well as startup and initialization
   files for them.

   Only relevant files from nrfx are imported. For instance, template files,
   the ones with startup code or strictly related to the installation of IRQs
   in the vector table are omitted in the import.

Dependencies:
   CMSIS header files
