/**
 * @brief Function for acquiring shared peripheral resources associated with
 *        the specified peripheral using instance pointer.
 *
 * Certain resources and registers are shared among peripherals that have
 * the same ID (for example: SPI0, SPIM0, SPIS0, TWI0, TWIM0, and TWIS0 in
 * nRF52832). Only one of them can be utilized at a given time. This function
 * reserves proper resources to be used by the specified peripheral.
 * If NRFX_PRS_ENABLED is set to a non-zero value, IRQ handlers for peripherals
 * that are sharing resources with others are invoked by the @ref nrfx_prs
 * module instead of the user code. The drivers must then specify their
 * interrupt handling routines with instance pointer and register them by using this function.
 *
 * @param[in] p_base_addr Requested peripheral base pointer.
 * @param[in] irq_handler Interrupt handler to register.
 * @param[in] p_instance  Pointer to shared peripheral instance structure used in
 *                        interrupt handling.
 *
 * @retval 0      If resources were acquired successfully or the specified peripheral is not handled
 *                by the PRS subsystem and there is no need to acquire resources for it.
 * @retval -EBUSY If resources were already acquired.
